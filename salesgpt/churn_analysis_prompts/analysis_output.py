## Step 2 - Conduct your analysis

Your analysis should be structured into **six** parts:

**Part 1 - 50 word interview analysis summary**

Task: Summarize the interview in 50 words or less, highlighting the key insights and most high-signal information. Write it as a single paragraph using markdown formatting to bold important terms. Ensure the summary is executive-friendly and provides a clear preview of the five other sections in the analysis.

**Part 2 - Answer to Question 1**

**The Key Insight:**
Provide 1-2 sharp, concise sentences that directly answers the key question from input 2 and and more broad from input 3.
- Also aim to state the main insight related to the goal and question
- Feel free to use the interviewee’s name
- Remember, this is for an executive / CEO level audience to brevity is key. Try to be high signal

**Summary Analysis and Supporting Evidence:**
- Offer a more detailed analysis in 2-3 bullet points. Each bullet point should provide a specific insight or observation supporting the key insights and related to the goal and question.
- Under each bullet point, provide specific wording from the transcript that supports your insight, including the timestamp. Feel free to use snippets of words rather than the whole sentence.

**Part 3 - Answer to Question 2**
*(Repeat the same structure as Part 1 for Question 2.)*
**Part 4 - Answer to Question 3**
*(Repeat the same structure as Part 1 for Question 2.)*
**Part 5 - Winback Opportunity**
Evaluate whether there is an opportunity to win back the customer based on the interview insights.

**Guidelines for the Winback Opportunity Section:**
- **Focus:** Determine if the interviewee expressed willingness to return or conditions under which they might reconsider the product or service.
- **Content:** Provide a concise assessment (1-2 sentences) of the winback potential.
- **Supporting Evidence:** Use specific quotes and timestamps from the transcript that indicate openness to re-engagement.
- **Action Steps:** Suggest specific actions that could be taken to win back the customer, ensuring they are distinct from general actionable recommendations.


**Part 6 - Customer Fit and Actionable Recommendations**

Based on the key insights and summary analyses from the previous sections, provide actionable recommendations that address the interviewee's concerns and suggestions.
**Customer Fit Evaluation*
- Begin with a brief customer fit evaluation before listing the recommendations.
- This evaluation will assess whether the customer's goals align with the product's offerings.
- Use input 
**Guidelines for Actionable Recommendations:**
- **Number of Recommendations:** Offer 2-3 specific, practical recommendations that the client can implement to improve their product or service.
- **Clarity and Feasibility:** Each recommendation should be brief (1-2 sentences) and directly related to the insights gained from the interview. Ensure that the recommendations are clear, feasible, and targeted to address the key issues identified.
- **Alignment with Customer Feedback:** Tie each recommendation back to specific points made by the interviewee, using their words where appropriate to strengthen the connection.
- **Prioritization (Optional):** If applicable, prioritize the recommendations in order of potential impact or urgency.



Considerations and tips:

- **Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE):** While the sections won’t be completely mutually exclusive and there will be some level of overlap. Try to work your analysis so there’s not too much repetition or overlap.
- **MECE Principle Again:** To minimize overlap, the **Winback Opportunity** section should focus on specific tactics to re-engage this particular customer, while the **Actionable Recommendations** should address broader improvements applicable to all customers.
- **Distinct Focus Areas:**
  - **Winback Opportunity:** Personal, immediate actions for customer re-engagement.
  - **Actionable Recommendations:** General strategic improvements for the product or service.
- **Cross-Referenced Insights:** If relevant, identify and combine relevant portions of the transcript that, when analyzed together, provide a deeper understanding of the interviewee's experiences or perceptions. This approach highlights interconnected themes and reinforces key insights with multiple pieces of supporting evidence.
- **Brivity:** Remember, brevity is key. We want to be extremely useful and high impact while not being too vorbose. The summary analysis should have 2 to 3 bullet point sections but if you need to expand because there’s a lot of insight, you can.
- **Take your time to think:** Think carefully about the conversation goal and the question before formulating your analysis and consider the most relevant parts of the transcript that address these points.
**Guideline for Titles:** Craft descriptive and specific titles (2-4 words) that capture the essence of each insight. Ensure titles are concise, impactful, and closely aligned with the customer’s goals and expectations. For example,  "Afternoon Focus Needs" when they've used the words afternoon and focus. Rather than something more generic like, "Needs not met".

## Step 3 - Provide your analysis in the following Markdown format for each of the five parts, wrapping each section with clear delimiters to facilitate parsing:

For each section, use the following format:

```markdown
<!-- START_SECTION: [Section Identifier] -->



[Your analysis for this part.]

<!-- END_SECTION: [Section Identifier] -->
```
