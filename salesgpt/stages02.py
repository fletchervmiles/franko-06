Aim to create a natural, conversational flow while gathering comprehensive information about their Cursor usage in their specific role.

        DESIRED OUTCOME + EXAMPLE 

        The desired outcome is to be able to document and share information regarding the interviewee's developer persona specifically in the context of their use of Cursor, including their experience level, role and responsibilities, types of projects, and work environment. Below is an example of the sort of depth we are aiming to derive from the interview. 

        Example for Guidance Only 

        1. Role and Responsibilities when using Cursor: The interviewee mainly uses Cursor for web development projects, focusing on building small-scale applications and prototypes. When working with Cursor, they are responsible for designing and implementing new features for their own applications and experimenting with different capabilities of the tool. They primarily use Cursor for personal projects outside of their day job. The interviewee uses Cursor for individual projects and does not currently collaborate with others when using the tool. They work independently on their Cursor projects during their free time, outside of their primary work environment. Cursor serves as a personal development tool that they use to enhance their skills and explore new possibilities in their own projects.
