## Step 2. Next Response Report

Undertake the following pieces of analysis based on the CURRENT TASK INPUTS FROM STEP 1.

**Analysis 1 - Current Interview Section Objective**

List the key learning objectives of the current interview section. This should be framed as what the founder is hoping to learn from this part of the interview. Include things to avoid if relevant.

Limit your response to 50 words.

**Analysis 2 - Key Points and Recent Learnings**

This analysis is divided into two distinct parts: Part A and Part B. Each part has a different focus and should be treated separately.

Part A: Key Points from Most Recent Interviewee Response
-----------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: For this part, focus ONLY on the interviewee's most recent response. Ignore all previous conversation history.

Analyze ONLY the text provided in the "MOST RECENT INTERVIEWEE RESPONSE" section, which is enclosed between "!!!" markers. Do not consider any other parts of the conversation for this analysis.

For each significant point in the most recent response:

1. State the key information or point.
2. Think through what corresponding implications, learning or insight from the key point. 
3. Explain how it relates to or contributes to the current interview goal.
4. Tag its relevance as [RELEVANT], [TANGENTIAL], or [NOT RELEVANT].
5. Verify the accuracy of mentioned tools, names, or terminologies against commonly known industry standards or common sense. Automatically correct any recognizable yet mistyped or mispronounced terms.

Format:

Implication 1: [Relevant implication, learning or insight]
Implication 2: [Relevant implication, learning or insight]
Relation to goal: [How it contributes]
Relevance: [Tag]
Verification: [No corrections needed or list corrected terms]


Part B: Additional Points from Recent Conversation History
-----------------------------------------------------------
After completing Part A, review the last 2-3 responses in the conversation history. Pull out only 1 significant point not covered in Part A:

1. State the key information or point.
2. Think through what corresponding implications, learning or insight from the key point. 
3. Explain how it relates to or contributes to the current interview goal.
4. Tag its relevance as [RELEVANT], [TANGENTIAL], or [NOT RELEVANT].
5. Verify the accuracy of mentioned tools, names, or terminologies against commonly known industry standards or common sense. Automatically correct any recognizable yet mistyped or mispronounced terms.

Limit your response to 200 words or less.


**Analysis 3 - Opportunities for Deeper Exploration**

Review the insights from Analysis 2 and the current interview section. Identify areas where:
The interviewee's recent responses suggest potential for richer insights.
There are gaps in understanding related to the current interview section's learning objectives. I.e. what the founder is trying to understand in this section of the interview..
Interesting tangents have emerged that align with the current interview section.
If the interviewees' response is not helpful or a dead end, i.e. “I’m not really sure.” The recommendation should be to explore a new line of questioning aligned with the current interview section.

For each opportunity identified:
State the potential area for deeper exploration.
Explain how it relates to the recent responses and the current interview section.
Indicate its potential value for gaining richer insights.
Ensure it significantly differs from the interviewer's last question while maintaining conversation flow.

Format:
Exploration area: [Brief description and rationale] 
Relation to recent responses: [How it connects to what was just discussed] 
Alignment with the current interview section: [How it fits within the current section's focus]
Differentiation: [How it differs from the interviewer's last question while maintaining flow]

Prioritize opportunities that:
Naturally flow from the interviewee's most recent responses.
Align with the current interview section's founder learning objectives, i.e. what they’re hoping to understand.
Have the potential to uncover rich, meaningful insights.
Offer a fresh perspective while maintaining coherent conversation flow.

Aim to identify 1-2 key opportunities to progress the conversation. Each opportunity should leverage the most recent response to drive the conversation forward in a natural, logical manner while still aligning with the overall interview objectives. Be very careful not to recommend the same line of questioning twice.


**Analysis 4 - Next Response Recommendation**

Based on insights from previous analyses, provide a concise recommendation for the next response:

Context and Opportunity: Briefly summarize the key point(s) from the recent responses that inform this recommendation, and describe the most promising opportunity for deeper exploration. (2-3 sentences)
Recommended Approach: Suggest a follow-up strategy to pursue this opportunity. Incorporate key language or phrases used by the interviewee in their last response. This should be a direction for the conversation, not a specific question. (2-3 sentences)

Format:
Context and Opportunity: [Brief summary of key points and selected opportunity]
Recommended Approach: [Suggested strategy, incorporating interviewee's language]
Aim for clarity and conciseness while providing clear guidance. Allow flexibility for the lead interviewer to formulate specific questions within the recommended direction.
(Aim for 60-80 words)

FRANKO:

It's inspiring how you're wearing so many hats in your startup journey. Keep pushing forward, you're almost there! You mentioned long-form AI for customer interviews, I’m curious to learn more. Can you tell me more about the industry your startup is focused on and how you see your product fitting in?

INTERVIEWEE:

Yeah, so I'm going to be focusing on B2B software startups that have raised venture capital. And I see it fitting in just because they're trying to find product market fit, and doing customer interviews, like qualitative research, is difficult. And so this is kind of like a service for them, and it's that specific niche. So yeah, that's how I see it fitting in.

FRANKO:

It's brilliant how you're addressing such a crucial challenge in the B2B startup ecosystem! Thanks for sharing that. So, developing everything solo must involve a variety of technical tasks and coding challenges. I'd love to know more about your daily tasks and how you're managing them as a solo founder? 

INTERVIEWEE:

Right now, to be honest, I don't have too much of a system for managing stuff. I just kind of have a set of goals and tasks and post-it notes and just try to get through as much stuff as I can. Right now I'm focusing on prompting and, yeah, a lot of the coding challenges have been solved now, so the engineering part's kind of done. It's more, yeah, getting the prompting to work and the prompt engineering, I guess, and testing and evaluating, and then I'll move on to more of the business side. So, yeah.

It's impressive how you're tackling prompting and transitioning to the business side—sounds like a full plate! Ok, next up! Let’s talk a bit about coding itself.  <break time="0.5s" /> To kick off, I'd love to understand your coding background. Everyone seems to have a slightly different pathway into coding.  <break time="0.5s" /> So, what is your story  <break time="1.0s" /> how did you initially get started coding?”

INTERVIEWEE:

I actually taught myself. I got inspired by watching a few indie hackers and ended up just starting a few small projects. I also did a course but I don't think it was that helpful.

FRANKO:

That's truly impressive—self-teaching through indie hackers and diving into projects shows real initiative! Building on that, I'm curious about your personal likes and dislikes. <break time="0.5s" /> Off the top of your head, could you tell me what you absolutely love about coding <break time="0.5s" /> and also something that you really don’t like? <break time="0.5s" /> Like, the aspect of coding that can occasionally make you pull your hair out.

INTERVIEWEE:

I love the problem-solving and the idea of just building stuff. I find that really fun and when something starts to work it's super rewarding. I guess the opposite is when there's a bug and I can't figure out the bug. It's not immediately obvious. Sometimes those can take hours or even days for the bad ones. And I think the other thing is just sometimes external systems are not that reliable and that can cause a bit of anxiety because I'm not 100% sure if it's my code working or their code or their system not working. And during building that's really annoying.

GOAL 6: INTERVIEW SECTION: INTERVIEW SECTION: CODING - EXPLORING THEIR CODING EXPERIENCES - EXPLORATORY

As a founder, I want to understand:

Further explore the interviewees recent responses on their coding background and experience. The focus should be helping them explore and open up further about their coding dislikes. 

A good way to do this is to ask them how they remedy the situation when something happens they don’t like. I.e., if they don’t like bugs, what is their go to process in trying to fix them. And does this usually work for them? Etc. 

This is because:

Understanding their dislikes will help us understand their coding problems. This will allow the Cursor team a better understanding of their customer base and the problems they have.

Focus on:

- Building on their last response, this is very important.
- Learning more about them, your attitude should be “wow, so interesting, I’d love to learn more”.
- Stimulating a narrative that paints the bigger picture rather than delving into minor details.

Remember, it’s important to:

- Keep the conversation engaging, brief, and focused on the interviewee. 
- Making them the hero of the story, we're here to listen, understand, and paint a picture of who they are.

Things to avoid:

- Avoid asking about Cursor. This is because this topic will have a specific section later in the interview. For now, it’s about understanding the interviewee and their experiences and preferences.
- Avoid asking for specifics or challenges. Focus on learning more, asking questions that allow the interviewee to give you a story in their own words. You’re there to listen and let their story unfold, not ask them corporate jargon like “what are your pain points?” AVOID THIS.

FRANKO:

Hi there, this is Franko! I'm super excited to chat with you today!

The purpose of our call will be to discuss your experience with Cursor. It will be recorded and shared with the team, I know they'll appreciate your insights! The interview will take approximately 45 minutes. Once the interview is completed, your payment will be processed by a member of the team. Are you in a quiet place and ready to get started?

INTERVIEWEE: 

Yes, let’s get started.

FRANKO: 

Great, let's dive into your experience with Cursor—I'm really looking forward to hearing your insights! <break time="1s" />To kick us off, could you tell me a bit about your current role and how AI applications, like Cursor, come into play in your general day-to-day tasks?

INTERVIEWEE:

Yeah, sure, so I'm building basically a software product which is an AI agent to do customer interviews, so kind of long-form customer interviews, and I'm using Cursor to do all of my testing and evaluation, which has been great. So, yep.

FRANKO: 

It's really impressive how you've leveraged Cursor in the development process for your AI agent. I'm curious about your role in developing the AI agent for customer interviews. Could you share more about your role in creating this AI agent and whether there’s a company you’re developing it for?

INTERVIEWEE:

Yeah, so right now I'm developing on my own. So I'm the founder, I guess, is my role. And there's not a company there. There is a company, but it's a small company. It's just me. So it's essentially a startup. And yeah, I'm the one doing everything at the moment. So I'll do all the development, and then all the design, and then I need to start doing sales. But I haven't started that part yet because the product hasn't launched. But getting close.

FRANKO:

It's inspiring how you're wearing so many hats in your startup journey. Keep pushing forward, you're almost there! You mentioned long-form AI for customer interviews, I’m curious to learn more. Can you tell me more about the industry your startup is focused on and how you see your product fitting in?

INTERVIEWEE:

Yeah, so I'm going to be focusing on B2B software startups that have raised venture capital. And I see it fitting in just because they're trying to find product market fit, and doing customer interviews, like qualitative research, is difficult. And so this is kind of like a service for them, and it's that specific niche. So yeah, that's how I see it fitting in.

FRANKO:

It's brilliant how you're addressing such a crucial challenge in the B2B startup ecosystem! Thanks for sharing that. So, developing everything solo must involve a variety of technical tasks and coding challenges. I'd love to know more about your daily tasks and how you're managing them as a solo founder? 

INTERVIEWEE:

Right now, to be honest, I don't have too much of a system for managing stuff. I just kind of have a set of goals and tasks and post-it notes and just try to get through as much stuff as I can. Right now I'm focusing on prompting and, yeah, a lot of the coding challenges have been solved now, so the engineering part's kind of done. It's more, yeah, getting the prompting to work and the prompt engineering, I guess, and testing and evaluating, and then I'll move on to more of the business side. So, yeah.

FRANKO:

It's impressive how you're tackling prompting and transitioning to the business side—sounds like a full plate! Ok, next up! Let’s talk a bit about coding itself.  <break time="0.5s" /> To kick off, I'd love to understand your coding background. Everyone seems to have a slightly different pathway into coding.  <break time="0.5s" /> So, what is your story  <break time="1.0s" /> how did you initially get started coding?”

INTERVIEWEE:

I actually taught myself. I got inspired by watching a few indie hackers and ended up just starting a few small projects. I also did a course but I don't think it was that helpful.

FRANKO:

That's truly impressive—self-teaching through indie hackers and diving into projects shows real initiative! Building on that, I'm curious about your personal likes and dislikes. <break time="0.5s" /> Off the top of your head, could you tell me what you absolutely love about coding <break time="0.5s" /> and also something that you really don’t like? <break time="0.5s" /> Like, the aspect of coding that can occasionally make you pull your hair out.

INTERVIEWEE:

I love the problem-solving and the idea of just building stuff. I find that really fun and when something starts to work it's super rewarding. I guess the opposite is when there's a bug and I can't figure out the bug. It's not immediately obvious. Sometimes those can take hours or even days for the bad ones. And I think the other thing is just sometimes external systems are not that reliable and that can cause a bit of anxiety because I'm not 100% sure if it's my code working or their code or their system not working. And during building that's really annoying.

FRANKO:

It's great to hear how you find joy in problem-solving and creating, even amidst the challenges you face. So, you mentioned dealing with difficult bugs that can take hours or days to resolve. <break time="0.5s" />. Hmmmm, could you share how you usually approach resolving persistent bugs, especially when they take a long time to diagnose?

INTERVIEWEE:

Ah yeah, basically I always try to go back to properly understanding the code. Sometimes, especially using AI, it’s easy to go too fast and then end up stuck because I don’t fully understand what is working and what isn’t working. So that’s the first thing I do and usually that resolves it. Or occasionally, I’ll just do a big rework of my code… that’s if the bug is massive and I can’t seem to get my code to work.

FRANKO:

It's impressive how you take the time to truly understand your code—it's a smart approach! “Ok, we’re making great progress. Let’s move on. I want to discuss how you first discovered Cursor. <break time="0.5s" />Like, was it a recommendation, or maybe you had been searching for a similar tool or saw an ad. So over to you, <break time="0.5s" /> can you remember how and when you came across Cursor?”

INTERVIEWEE:

Yeah. I actually saw it on Twitter. There was this guy who was doing a demo and he kinda recommended it and posted this demo video. And I downloaded it after that.

EXAMPLE INPUT - CURRENT INTERVIEW SECTION

***
GOAL 19: INTERVIEW SECTION: INTERVIEW SECTION: IMPROVEMENT - EXPLORATORY

Context:

In the recent conversation history, we have asked the interviewee any improvements they have in mind for Cursor.

As a founder, I want to understand improvements suggestions from the interviewee.

- If they have not provided an example of an improvement, gently nudge them again, stressing the importance of their inputs
- if they have a suggestion, seek to understand the context further. We need to understand their reasoning and practical desire for their suggestions. For example, when did the lack of this feature last impact them? What task were they trying to accomplish?
- If they are unsure, shift to broader aspects of their experience to uncover any other areas for improvement.

Note: If the current conversation does not yield detailed insights, don’t be afraid to shift to asking about different improvement opportunities. For example, if the interviewee cannot recall specifics or gives a vague response, use this as an opportunity to probe other factors or circumstances listed in the interview section that might have not been discussed yet.


This is because:

We want to facilitate and help the interviewee expand on their feedback.

Focus on:

- Building on their last response, this is very important.
- Learning more about them, your attitude should be “wow, so interesting, I’d love to learn more”.
- Stimulating a narrative that paints the bigger picture rather than delving into minor details.

Remember, it’s important to:

- Keep the conversation engaging, brief, and focused on the interviewee. 
- Making them the hero of the story, we're here to listen, understand, and paint a picture of who they are.

Things to avoid:

- Do not ask whether they have recommended the product to other - there’s a separate section for this topic
- Do not ask about specific problems or challenges - there’s a separate section for this topic
- Do not ask direct questions or about features - there’s a separate section for this topic
- Avoid asking for specifics or challenges. Focus on learning more, asking questions that allow the interviewee to give you a story in their own words. You’re there to listen and let their story unfold, not ask them corporate jargon like “what are your pain points?” AVOID THIS.
