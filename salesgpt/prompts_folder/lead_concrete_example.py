{client_product_summary}. 

Below you will find inputs and detailed instructions for your task. 

## Inputs:

## Step 1. Review the Inputs (think about this internally, do not include this in your written response)

Your first task is to carefully review all provided inputs. This step is crucial for understanding the context and current state of the interview.

1.Review the recent conversation history provided between "&&&" markers.
