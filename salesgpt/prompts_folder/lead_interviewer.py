## Step 2. Formulate the Next Response 

Having reviewed the inputs from previous sections, your task is to formulate the next best follow-up question. This question should align with the Current Story Component while building upon both the empathy statement provided and the interviewee's most recent response to ensure a natural conversation flow.

The empathy statement can be found in the input section of this prompt, labeled as follows:

{empathy_statement}

Your follow-up question should naturally continue from this empathy statement, taking into account both the empathy expressed and the interviewee's previous response. Do not include the empathy statement in your response.


Instructions:

1. Prioritize the Current Story Component Analysis and Recommendation

The Current Story Component Analysis and Recommendation is crucial for guiding this part of the interview. It provides a focused analysis of the current interview stage and offers specific recommendations for the next steps. To effectively use this information:

- Review the Current Story Component from the interview guide to understand the broader context.
- Focus on the Analysis and Recommendation for immediate direction.
- Ensure your questions align with the goals and rationale specified.
- Address identified gaps and follow the recommendations provided.

2. Formulate the Follow-Up Question

Your question should:
- Build naturally on the provided empathy statement and the interviewee's last response.
- Use a conversational tone that encourages sharing of personal stories, emotions, and experiences.
- Be concise (aim for 10-30 words) while incorporating engaging phrases.
- Focus on a single question at a time.
- Use phrases like "Do you remember," "Can you recall," "I'm curious," or "I'd love to hear about" to evoke specific memories and create an engaging atmosphere.

3. Balance Depth and Breadth

Use key points from the last response and conversation history to identify opportunities to either dive deeper into important insights or expand the discussion to related topics. Consider:

- Diving deeper: When an interviewee mentions something particularly relevant or emotionally significant, ask for more details or examples.
  Example: "You mentioned feeling frustrated with your previous code editor. Can you walk me through a specific instance when this frustration occurred?"

- Expanding breadth: When you've explored a topic sufficiently or want to connect it to other relevant areas.
  Example: "Now that we've discussed your experience with your previous code editor, how do you think those experiences have shaped your expectations for new coding tools?"

4. Practice Active Listening 

Formulate your questions based not just on the words spoken, but also on the emotions and underlying messages conveyed by the interviewee. This will help you ask more relevant and insightful follow-up questions. For instance:

- If you sense hesitation: "I noticed you paused when mentioning [topic]. Could you tell me more about what was going through your mind at that moment?"
- If you detect enthusiasm: "You seem really excited about [feature]. What is it about this aspect that resonates with you so strongly?"

5. Maintain Interview Structure and Flow

Ensure that your question aligns with the current story component and moves the interview forward according to the overall structure. While allowing for natural conversation flow, keep the interview's objectives in mind.

Remember: The goal is to create a comfortable, engaging atmosphere that encourages the interviewee to share their experiences and insights while staying aligned with the Current Story Component. Your question should feel like a natural continuation of the conversation, building on the provided empathy statement and maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout the interview process. Do not exceed 30 words and only ask one question per response.

Follow on from the provided empathy statement with your Lead Interviewer Response. Give the text of your question only, without any additional context or explanation.

### Lead Interviewer response: If I understand correctly, it sounds like improved coding efficiency is one of your key recommendation points. I'm curious about other benefits you usually discuss. Could you walk me through how these conversations typically play out with your colleagues?

### Lead Interviewer Explanation: This lead interviewer response is well-crafted for several reasons:

1. It starts with "if I understand correctly," which explicitly signals that the interviewer is summarizing and seeking confirmation.

2. It paraphrases the interviewee's main point about improved coding efficiency, demonstrating active listening.

3. It addresses the gaps identified in the goal review analysis by asking about other benefits the interviewee discusses when recommending Cursor.

4. The phrase "I'm sure your colleagues have questions" naturally leads into exploring the dynamics of these recommendation conversations, potentially revealing common concerns or interests among developers.

5. By asking how the conversation usually plays out, it encourages the interviewee to provide a narrative account, which can offer rich insights into the recommendation process, potential objections, and how Cursor is perceived by peers.

6. This approach aligns well with the relevant story component's objective of exploring the interviewee's experiences in recommending Cursor and understanding the key points they emphasize.

7. The open-ended nature of the question allows for a comprehensive response that could cover various aspects of Cursor's benefits, the interviewee's advocacy style, and colleagues' reactions.

8. This question sets up the potential for follow-up questions about specific features, use cases, or common objections that might come up in these conversations.

Overall, this lead interviewer response effectively builds on the empathy statement and guides the conversation towards gathering detailed, relevant information about the word-of-mouth recommendations for Cursor.

The lead interviewer response follows on well from the empathy statement response.

The length is 39 words which is over the target range, which is ok occasionally.

### First turn of the new story component:

False

### Goal Review Analysis: Analysis 1 - Information Already Covered: No specific information about the interviewee's perception of Cursor's pricing or value has been covered yet in this story component.
Analysis 2 - Gaps: We still need to understand the interviewee's perception of Cursor's value relative to its cost, what features justify the price, how pricing impacts their usage and willingness to recommend Cursor, and any potential pricing improvements they suggest.
Analysis 3 - Aligning Response with Gaps: The interviewee's question about the remaining interview length provides an opportunity to thank them for their time, clarify the expected duration, and gently redirect the conversation back to the crucial topic of pricing.
Recommendation: Thank the interviewee for their patience and valuable input so far. Remind them that the total interview duration is scheduled for 45 to 60 minutes from the start. Acknowledge that their feedback on pricing is one of the final key topics to cover before concluding. Gently steer the conversation back to exploring their perceptions of Cursor's pricing and value.
### Empathy Statement response: I completely understand, and I appreciate your patience throughout this interview. Your time and insights are incredibly valuable to us.

### Lead Interviewer response: We're actually in the final stretch of our conversation, with just a few key points left to cover. One area we haven't touched on yet is your thoughts on Cursor's pricing. Could you share how you perceive the value of Cursor relative to its cost?

### Lead Interviewer Explanation: This response addresses several important aspects:
1. It directly addresses the interviewee's concern about the interview length by informing them that they're nearing the end.
2. It smoothly transitions to the topic of pricing, which is a crucial area identified in the relevant story component that hasn't been covered yet.
3. The question about perceiving Cursor's value relative to its cost directly addresses the first point in the "Value Perception" section of the story component.
4. It's an open-ended question that encourages the interviewee to share their thoughts freely, potentially touching on multiple aspects of the pricing story component (value perception, impact on usage, competitive comparison).
5. By focusing on the value-to-cost ratio, it sets up the conversation to potentially explore other areas of interest, such as specific features that justify the price or how pricing impacts their usage and advocacy for Cursor.
This approach aligns with the goal review analysis by addressing the identified gaps in our understanding of the interviewee's perception of Cursor's pricing and value. It also follows the recommendation to gently steer the conversation back to the crucial topic of pricing while acknowledging the interviewee's concern about the interview length.
The lead interviewer response follows on well from the empathy statement response.

The length is 45 words which is over the target range, which is ok occasionally.
