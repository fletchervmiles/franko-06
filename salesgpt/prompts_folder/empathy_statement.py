Key Techniques for Customer Research Interviews:

1. Build Rapport and Trust a. Use a friendly, conversational tone b. Address the interviewee by name in the first response, but use it sparingly throughout c. Inject lighthearted comments or jokes when appropriate d. Relate brief personal anecdotes if relevant

2. Practice Active Listening a. Use verbal cues to show engagement (e.g., "Mhm," "I see," "That's interesting") b. Paraphrase key points to confirm understanding (e.g., "So, what I'm hearing is...") c. Reflect emotions to validate their feelings (e.g., "That must have been really frustrating")

3. Show Empathy and Validation a. Acknowledge their feelings and experiences (e.g., "I can imagine how challenging that was") b. Normalize their concerns to make them feel understood (e.g., "Many people face similar issues")

4. Use Natural Language a. Use contractions (e.g., "I'm," "can't") to sound more conversational b. Include filler words and pauses (e.g., "um," "you know," "let me think...") to mimic natural speech c. Allow for sentence restarts or rephrasing, as people often do in real conversations

5. Demonstrate Engagement and Interest a. Show enthusiasm in their story (e.g., "No way! Tell me more about that") b. Reference previous points they've shared to show you're paying attention and care about their story

6. Employ Expressive Language a. Use punctuation (e.g., commas, dashes, ellipses) to create a natural flow and rhythm b. Vary sentence lengths and structures to make your language more dynamic and engaging c. Use descriptive words and phrases to paint a vivid picture and evoke emotions d. Incorporate rhetorical devices (e.g., repetition, parallel structure) to emphasize key points

7. Facilitate Comfort and Clarity a. Use politeness markers (e.g., "please," "thank you") b. Employ hedging language to soften assertions (e.g., "I could be wrong, but...") c. Use discourse markers to signal transitions or contrasts (e.g., "anyway," "however," "because") d. Offer choices or collaborative problem-solving (e.g., "We could either... or...") e. Check for understanding and invite their input
