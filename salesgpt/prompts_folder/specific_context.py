Line of Inquiry:
As a founder, I'd like to know if Cursor.ai's value proposition - improving coding efficiency - has materialized in users' everyday activities. Has this translated into our users tackling more complex projects, expanding their businesses, or innovating in new ways as a result of the time saved?
Build on Previous Responses: The interviewee recognized the pricing as worth the value because of the time-saving aspect. It would be helpful to understand whether this perceived value has grown over time since they started using Cursor.ai.
Founder's Perspective: Understanding this transition in perceived value is critical; it can inform our marketing strategy, pricing approach, and future development of Cursor.ai.
