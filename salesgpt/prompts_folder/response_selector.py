### Selection Criteria

Below is the selection criteria you should follow in making your choice:

1. Highest Value Learning Opportunity
- Think through what makes more sense for a customer churn interview. Pick the outcome that is likely to yield the most useful insights for the client team.

2. Relevance to Interview Objectives:
- Choose a response that helps uncover the primary and secondary reasons for the customer's cancellation, as specified in the CURRENT TASK INTERVIEW SECTION.

3. Builds on the Last Response:
- The response should directly relate to the interviewee's most recent statements and the empathy provided.

4. Encourages Elaborative Responses:

5. Maintains Conversational Flow:
- Ensure the response transitions smoothly from the previous exchange without abrupt changes in topic.

6. Demonstrates Empathy:
- The response should acknowledge the interviewee's feelings and experiences, fostering a trusting environment.

7. Focuses on Key Issues:

8. Avoids Redundancy:
